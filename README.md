# Inventory Management System

This is a simple inventory management system built with Spring Boot and Gradle. It allows users to view a list of available products, add new products, and update existing ones. Each product has a name, description, price, and quantity.

## Features

- View a list of available products
- Add new products
- Update existing products

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Gradle
- MySQL

## Database Configuration

In your `application.properties` file, configure your MySQL database:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=db_url
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your actual MySQL username and password.

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eshonkulov-asliddin/inventory-system-with-gpt.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd inventory-management-system  
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Running Tests and Generating Code Coverage Report
You can run the tests and generate the code coverage report with the following command:
```bash
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```
The code coverage report is saved in the build/reports/jacoco/test directory.

## Running SonarQube Analysis (Optional)

If you have SonarQube installed, you can run the SonarQube analysis with the following command:
```bash
./gradlew sonarqube
```

## Quality Checks
The project includes unit tests with a code coverage of over 80%. The code quality is checked using SonarQube, which checks the code coverage, complexity, and coding style.

# Feedback
- **Was it easy to complete the task using AI?**  
  Yes, the AI was able to provide accurate and helpful responses that made it easier to complete the task.

- **How long did task take you to complete?**  
  The task took approximately 2-3 hours to complete.

- **Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?**  
  The code generated by the AI was mostly ready to run. I only had to make a few minor adjustments to fit my specific use case.

- **Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?**  
  The main challenge was understanding how to properly configure SonarQube and JaCoCo for code coverage analysis. The AI was able to provide clear instructions on how to do this.

- **Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?**  
  I learned that it's a good practice to use environment variables to store sensitive information like the SonarQube token. This keeps the sensitive information out of the code and makes it easier to change the values without having to modify the code.
